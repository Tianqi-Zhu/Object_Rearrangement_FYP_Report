# Object Rearrangement Under Geometric and Commonsense Constraints

I came up with the topic above largely on my own. I am interested in continue doing research along this line or something relevant.

The main point of the project is to minimize human "hard" coding of various environment specifications etc for robotics to place objects in a constrained physical structure, which enables the same system structure to be generalizable to new environments and conditions.

I am looking for research assistant or PhD student positions. Please contact TianqiZhu at u dot nus dot edu if you have opportunity available.

I am also interested in server resources, robotics etc, if i could borrow some from someone to use for a short period.

Thanks for reading. Have a nice day.
